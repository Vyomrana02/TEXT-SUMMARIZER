The environment is the natural world around an organism that allows it to survive. The French word ‘environ,’ which means ‘to surround,’ is derived from the English word ‘environment.’ It is made up of living creatures like plants, animals, and human beings. The non-living elements of the environment are air, water, and land. Nature has designed its functioning in such a way that everything is interdependent. Human beings are the most powerful of all the creatures that rely on and make use of the earth’s natural resources. Air is required for the survival of not just humans but also plants and animals. Without air, there will be no life on Earth. Human beings alone are responsible for the degradation of the environment. The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere are the different layers that make up the environment. Several gases, like oxygen and nitrogen, that are required for life are found in the atmosphere. The hydrosphere is made up of different water bodies like rivers, oceans, seas, etc. The lithosphere is the earth’s outermost layer, which is made up of rock and soil. The biosphere is home to all living beings. The environment is influenced by a variety of elements, some of which are natural and others man-made.
